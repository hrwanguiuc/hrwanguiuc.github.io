Hi I am Haoran, a graduate student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This page is my analysis about how to "brand" myself and what are my personal features recognized by my friends. 

### 1.Self-analysis
Here is a summary about the strengths and weaknesses of myself:

I think the most important characteristic that could distinguish myself is the willingness to talk about my own experience and listen to other's experience to learn something.  I think the best way for us to improve ourselves is learning from the past experience. Therefore, I really enjoy the reviewing of my own fault and success in the past, from study to life. At the same time, I am also listening to other's story like why a guy like Mark Zuckerberg could build an empire of the social media. So I think this is one of the most important characteristics that I would like to share. And it could be one of the most greatest competitiveness for one brand since we are always listening to our customers and willing to learn from the past experience.

On the other hand, I also need to overcome the weaknesses listed above. The most serious one I think is the confidence when trying new things and new methods. Sometimes I feel like there is not enough confidence to try an unknown way to solve problems in the daily study. This bad behavior has a great impact on each aspects of the daily life. For instance, I usually had a hard time to make a final decision between two options. This is the direct impact of the lacking of confidence. So I believe this is one of the biggest weaknesses that I should overcome recently, which could improve other aspects if I could overcome this one at the first place.

### 2.External Analysis:
I also asked my friends and family members the true opinions about me in terms of strength and weakness. Here is a brief summary:

### 3.Analysis of the two results:
Some of my friends had the same opinions with me that I have a great passion on what I am really interested in. So for one brand, this is really important as customer wants to see this company has a great vision and the willingness to innovate more creative products and service. But they also pointed out that I should take more time practicing starting a new conversion with strangers in an unfamiliar circumstance. Besides, several of my friends talked the same strength of me, they think I am a easy-going person and a good team player to work with. But there are different opinions about my weaknesses and which one is the first priority to overcome. My family think I should take a work-life-balance even though I am still studying at the college. They are talking more about I should pay more attention to the life instead of concentrating all my attention on the study and the work. I think the biggest incongruence is that I may focus on a single aspect (e.g. study) to improve while my friends and family take the whole picture and think that I need to improve myself in the difference aspects in the life. I totally agree with their opinions. I believe their opinions and comments is a great guidance for me to take a better look about the weaknesses and think about how to improve in my missing parts. So, for one brand, this is the similar situation because customers will give different opinions on which is the drawbacks of the brand and what is the most urgent to improve. So I think I could put more time to listen to different opinions before publishing any innovation under this brand. Maybe it is not what the customers really want to see.

In addition, I think they agree on some of the advantages of my personal characteristics when I collected the comments from them. It is a good for one brand as the people who are familiar with it give the same opinions on the strength of that brand. And it means I should keep this characteristic as it is one of the most recognized characteristics for me and in other words, for this brand.

### 4.The "feature-benefit" model
After reviewing the analysis above, I think the most important features I should advertise is: easy-going, likes to talk to people(customers), always listening to people(customers), great passion on new technologies and things(passion on innovation to make better products and service). I think these are the dominant features of me as a "brand" to other people. And at the same time, I should also overcome the weaknesses as much as possible in order to become more competitive in the society(market). 

So this is a general self-branding analysis of me as a "brand". Please contact me if you have great ideas or opinions!
